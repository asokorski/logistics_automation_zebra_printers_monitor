#Zebra printers monitor

App developed to monitor the status of the zebra label printers at a workplace. Snmp connection gets the basic information based on OIDs. Unfortunately the most essential configuration is not stored in OIDs, so for more details and making changes in the config, TCP solution must be used. The idea is to be able to easily access the configuration of any of the printers on-site and reupload the correct configuration based on the backup template.
